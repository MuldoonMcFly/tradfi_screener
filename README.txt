Libraries used:
- pandas
- pyEX
- sqlite3 (should be built in)


Instructions:
1. Create a file called tokens.py in the screener\apis folder. 
2. Add two variables, sandbox_token and production_token
3. Add your IEX Cloud Sandbox and Production tokens as strings (an IEX Cloud account with a Sandbox API token can be created for free)

Warning: IEX Cloud's Sandbox tokens return random values. YMMV.
